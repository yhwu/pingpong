## Physics of table tennis

This is my understanding of table tennis by analyzing trajectories of a ping pong ball. We will see why shots are executed in different ways, the tricks applied behind them, and the sensations we should be looking for to guide our practice. 

#### Grab the ball, engage the rubber, the key is acceleration.

First and foremost, whether it is for serve return, looping, or flipping, coaches universally emphasize the importance of grabbing, gripping, or holding the ball. But how? The key is to prolong acceleration or deceleration.

When you hit an incoming ball, the ball will soon decelerate to a stop and then accelerate in the opposite direction, and when it is faster than the paddle it flies away. It is only when the ball and rubber are in contact, you have the opportunity to apply power, spin, and direction. The longer the contact, the more margin of error you have. One way to increase this duration is to approach the incoming ball slowly so that it takes longer time to slow down, and accelerate after contact so that it takes longer time for the ball to catch up in speed. In one swing, it is a quick acceleration. 

The best players to illustrate this simple physics are Timo Boll and Zhang JiKe. Please watch their training videos, and pay attention to how much acceleration there is when they do loops and drives. Their strokes have three distinct stages: 

1. catch -- decelerate the ball by a slower constant speed mostly driven by the body, 
2. carry -- accelerate by body and arm, 
3. throw -- final kick by wrist and finger.

In the first stage, you catch things with a stable arm and so you move the arm by your legs and body. If you reach the ball by the arm, you will tense the arm mussels and change the arm angle from a relaxed one to either too open or too closed one, both of which will  increase the difficulty and reduce efficiency of the second stage. 

Following the start up from the first stage, you quickly release the full power by twisting the body and closing the arm angle. This looks like carrying the ball over the net. Executed correctly, it is pretty fast already. But if you want to precision and consistence, you have to sacrifice power to adjust angles. This is done subconsciously. But, nonetheless, there is a compromise.

Wrist and fingers can better control paddle angles. If one is holding his paddle kind of loosely when swinging his arm, his wrist will be bent a little bit, which naturally provides a good start to throw forward. In fact, one doesn't even need think about it. Simply squeezing the handle quickly is enough to straighten one's wrist and exert a lot more forward motion in addition to the fast moving arm. Sometimes we see advanced players not really moving their arms but their balls are fast. That's why.

Ma Long's strokes are too fluid, but you can still see the acceleration.  

In the following, we will analyze how to use wrist and fingers to control acceleration to make different kinds of shots. It is all about physics.


#### Spin acceleration, don't brush, scratch.
People use the term "brush" to describe the action to spin the ball. Brush gives an impression that it is brief and gentle, as if one is afraid to touch something. Put your hand on a globe and try to spin it up as fast as possible in one pull. What would you do? A little kid knows first you need put your hand on the globe firmly, then slide it fast while pushing against the axis. The key is that the globe must go with your hand in sync for as long as your are accelerating. It's definately not a brush. Scratch sounds like a better word for it. The same principle applies to ping pong. No matter how fast or spinny it is, it takes a process to change its trajectory and rotation. And the best way to spin it up is to scratch it around as if your rubber had claws on it. So, if you want to generate some back spin, you paddle goes down and forward; if you want top spin, you paddle goes up and forward. If you only do a tangent brush, the ball leaves the rubber surface while your paddle is still accelerating. That last bit of forward and around the ball motion is usually seen as a means to control the ball's direction, while more importantly, it gives extra spin to the ball.


#### Stop spin.
Unless you are borrowing the spin, you can not let a spining ball roll or slide on the surface of your rubber. The ball rolls when there is only friction on the surface and there is little friction against the rubber. This happens when you do a light touch, i.e., the ball does not dent the rubber and there is nothing to stop its rotation. So, in order to stop the spin, we have to let the ball sink so that it can only roll into the rubber. The deeper it sinks, the tighter the rubber hugs the ball. It is important to realize that you have to stop the spin before the rubber dents the most. At the moment when the rubber dents the most, there is a gradual loss of pressure from the center of contact to the surounding region. If the ball is still rotating, the rubber will be effectively reinforcing the spin. So, it is impotant that we apply acceleration to incoming spinny balls so that they feels tighter and tighter until they loose spin. 

Usually, ameteur players(me included) are prone to make this kind of mistake. They are afraid of popping the ball up. They do block at a relatively closed angle, but they don't hold their paddle tight or they withdraw a little upon contact. They wanted to block it softly so that the ball wouldn't go up. Of course, we know blocking in this way will get exactly the oppersite. If you let the ball loose, it goes where it wants. So, how much of dent should we apply to return a spinny ball back with no spin? Just as much as when the spin was generated. Sounds delicate, but the execution is easy. 

Let's say, a ball is coming at really low speed but a mediaun to heavy top spin of 3000 rpm. The speed of the rubber to generate this much of spin equals 3000 rpm / 60 second * 2 * pi * 0.02 (20mm) = 6.28 meter / second, or 14 MPH, which is a relatively low to medium speed. So, it just takes a simple block to control the spin, but, remember to hold the paddle tight. Now let's see how much it takes to return Xu Xin's 9000 rpm spin. The rotational speed transaltes into 9000 rpm / 60 second * 2 * pi * 0.02 (20mm) = 18.84 meter/second. It would require a fast block to control the spin if the ball is incoming at a low speed. However, such spinny balls usually come at high speeds. Maybe it is already faster than 12 m/s and you still just need a simple block. Generally, for hard loop drives, the translational(toward you) energy is higher than the rotational energy. The ball will stop its own spin on a solid impact. And, this is exactly what you see when you watch advanced players practicing loops and returning with backhand blocks. They block everything with a simple block. They hardly even move or change the bat angles.  It does require a lot of confidence in physics to believe that one can return Xu Xin, Ma Long's loop drives just by holding his paddle still and firm. Any lack of confidence will result in tiny movements of your paddle and the balls will rebound wildly. 


#### Loop drive.
Simply hitting the ball with a relatively closed tangent angle will render the trajectory low, but the ball will lack both power and spin. 

#### High loop.

#### Chop block.
