## Physics of table tennis

This is my understanding of table tennis by analyzing trajectories of a ping pong ball. We will see why shots are executed in different ways, the tricks applied behind them, and the sensations we should be looking for to guide our practice. 

#### Grab the ball, engage the rubber, the key is acceleration.

First and foremost, whether it is for serve return, looping, or flipping, coaches universally emphasize the importance of grabbing, gripping, or holding the ball. But how? The key is to prolong acceleration or deceleration.

When you hit an incoming ball, the ball will soon decelerate to a stop and then accelerate in the opposite direction, and when it is faster than the paddle it flies away. When the ball and rubber are in contact, you have the opportunity to apply its spin and direction. The longer the contact, the more margin of error you have. Thee only way to increase this duration is to approach the incoming ball slowly so that it takes longer time to slow down, and accelerate after contact so that it takes longer time for the ball to catch up in speed. As we mostly hit forward, so basicly, in order to better control the ball, we need to accelerate the paddle. 

The best players to illustrate this simple physics are Timo Boll and Zhang JiKe. Please watch their training videos, and pay attention to how much acceleration there is when they do loops and drives. Their strokes have three distinct stages: 

1. catch -- decelerate the ball by a slower constant speed mostly driven by body, 
2. carry -- accelerate by body and arm, 
3. throw -- final kick by wrist and finger.

In the first stage, you catch things with a stable arm and so you move the arm by your legs and body. If you reach the ball by the arm, you will tense the arm mussels and change the arm angle from a relaxed one to either too open or too closed one, both of which will  increase the difficulty and reduce efficiency of the second stage. 

Following the start up from the first stage, you quickly release the full power by twisting the body and closing the arm angle. This looks like carrying the ball over the net. Executed correctly, it is pretty fast already. But if you want to precision and consistence, you have to sacrifice power to adjust angles. This is done subconsciously. But, nonetheless, there is a compromise.

Wrist and fingers can better control paddle angles. If one is holding his paddle kind of loosely when swinging his arm, his wrist will be bent a little bit, which naturally provides a good start to throw forward. In fact, one doesn't even need think about it. Simply squeezing the handle quickly is enough to straighten one's wrist and exert a lot of forward motion on the ball. Sometimes we see advanced players not really moving their arms but their balls are fast. That's why.

Ma Long's strokes are too fluid, but you can still see the acceleration.  

In the following, we will analyze how to use wrist and fingers to control acceleration to make different kinds of shots. It is all about physics.


#### Spin acceleration, don't brush, scratch.
People use the term "brush" to describe the action to spin the ball. Brush gives an impression that it is brief and gentle, as if one is afraid to touch it. Put your hand on a globe and try to spin it up as fast as possible in one pull. What would you do? A little kid knows first you need a good grip, then you need slide it fast while pushing against the axis to stay in contact. You need to make sure the globe go with your hand in sync for as long as your are accelerating. It's definately not a brush. Scratch sounds like a better word for it. The same principle applies to ping pong balls. No matter how fast, how spinny it is, it takes a process to change its trajectory and rotation. And the best way to spin it up is to scratch it around as if your rubber had claws on it.


#### Loop drive.
Simply hitting the ball with a relatively closed tangent angle will render the trajectory low, but the ball will lack both power and spin. 

#### High loop.

#### Chop block.
