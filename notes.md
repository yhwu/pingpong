## Return heavy sidespin

> No matter what effective option you choose, you have to solve what is your problem with this serve, which is your failure to accurately read the spin. Anything you do without first figuring out how to read the spin will continue to fail you. This is regardless of type of rubber. Options and techniques for LP, anti, and SP are different and I do not discuss them.
> 
> The passive options have been discussed and they are a fail if you cannot read the spin. You are likely to pop up the ball, or spray it, or net it , or bump it out. If you can read the spin, you can go with the spin. You just impact opposite of what you see. This is assuming normal inverted rubber. You can push, but with topspin on ht eball, you will have to stroke down and with the sidespin to the side. A safer thing to do is to wait on hte ball (assuming it is a fast side/top gpoing deep) and chop it. Even if you left it high, as long as it is deep, you still have chances as you hopefully put a lot od spin on it or disguised your spin.

> You can use the correct angle and block, either passively or active. That is the safest and easiest thing. You don't need a backswing, you don't need to run into a position to FH loop, you simply move one step, plant body, lean a little forward and do it. Bad thing is, this return can be countered right by you if opponent is ready for it. Some opponents are so surprised that you returned their best serve, the return itself suprises them and they might make a mistake trying to attack.

> You can do a 1/2 power loop with a shortened backswing. This is the safest way to make an aggressive return. Be sure to balance brushing the ball and hitting through it. You will get a lot of spin and if you place it deep in a good spot like the crossover, it will likely not get attacked, or at least not very aggressively. You have to read the spin, wait for the ball, get down, and get up as you stroke half-power with control. You cannot rush this shot or you will end up reaching and hiting it too early without any control to spray it everywhere. This is your best balance of being aggressive and playing it safe.

> You can also try to drive the ball. Some do this very well, like 99.99 percent of Korean club players who can do this all day long. Even Newbs do this well 50 times in a row at fast pace. if you do not drive well, (like me, who loops a lot better than he drives) this shot will be a fail for you. If you are a good counter-driver (which it sounds like you are NOT) this is a pretty effective shot that will put the opponent under time and distance pressure right away and might win the point.
>  
> You can also try to fast loop it. This is the most aggressive shot with the potential to both lose the point right away or win it. (Then you get to holler BY-YOU! like an annoying Cho-bot hehe) You really need to read the ball, move to position, get down and time it all correctly. That is asking for a lot, unless the serve went right to your FH power alley. You accellerate right through the ball and try to power it right by opponent, usually down his FH line. This requires a LOT of quick recognition and fast footwork if the serve is done right at your crossover or breaking away towards your BH, which it often does. You really have to move and get down plus the timing is tough. Not mission impossible, but this shot is very aggressive and advanced for even some 2000 USATT level players.

> Training for this serve shouldn't be all that difficult as long as you can find a player willing to serve you side top and given you have a lot of balls. Having a netted off training area is better. Having a collection net on wheels behind the table is even better.
>  
> Try practicing ALL of these options. Eventually, you will get better at reading spin and especially from this opponent. Never pass up a chance to hit with new players or better yet, those with serves or shots that trouble you.


> I've done a few different things against this serve depending on my opponent:
> 1.  Backhand loop - not as consistent as I would like
> 2.  Chop - I did this at a tournament about a year ago because I wasn't looping it well, and I couldn't think of anything safer
> 3.  Simple block - only against players that don't have a strong 3rd ball attack
> 4.  Roll over it - this is my most effective return.  Using a lot of wrist and just a little forward motion, I just kind of throw the ball to the other side.  Hard to explain in words.
