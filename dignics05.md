## Dignics 05 Review

Dignics 05, the newest innovation from Butterfly received conflicting reviews. Some people say it's the most tolerant rubber; some say it's the least. I agree with both. In this review, I will try to rationalize common opinions by analyzing its properties. A few key points are:

 - D05 combines a powerful hard sponge and a soft grippy top sheet,
 - it takes longer time to engage, it takes longer time to release,
 - the soft top sheet make it a low throw rubber,
 - a low throw makes it difficult to control by brushing,
 - a low throw makes it easier to do loop drives and smashes.


### Physical properties

My references are Hurricane 3 NEO, Nittaku Fastarc G1. These 3 rubbers do play differently. Starting with basic facts, 
in terms of speed, D05 > G1 > H3N, 
and in terms of tackiness, H3N > G1 > D05. 
Many tension rubbers fall into that category. D05 is unique because of the soft top sheet.

So, what does the soft top sheet do? When we hit a ball, there are two forces applied on it. One is in the opposite direction of the ball, and the other is tangential. The direct force makes it return, and the tangential force make it rotate. Since the ball will dent in the rubber, the tangential force also makes it go sideways, hence you can loop a ball high. As a soft surface deforms easier than a hard one, its tangent force tends to make it rotate more instead of lifting it up, thus making it a low throw rubber. Throw angle measures the tendency that a ball follows the rubber's tangent force. For looping, a low throw angle means the ball's trajectory will be flatter; for pushing, a low throw causes the ball not to move downward as much and prone to pop up. A low or high throw is not necessarily bad. Either way, the energy is not lost as long as one can get a solid grip. It is up to the users how to use it.

In comparison, H3N and G1 are high throw rubbers due to their harder top sheets. People usually perceive that as having more control. It is kind of true as the ball follows more with the paddle's movement, e.g., the ball goes up and clears the net if you brush up, whereas, using low throw rubbers, the ball may not go up as high and instead goes into the net. Many people like to boost hurricane rubbers. They are essentially expanding and softening the sponge and top sheet to achieve more catapult and lower throw. The combined effect is more speed and spin at the cost of control, making it more like D05.

D05's top sheet is grippy, but not as grippy as H3N or G1. It is soft and it does not bounce a ball much on its own. As a result, it is very tolerant at passive serve returns, like a worn out mushy rubber. One can do a simple test to appreciate D05's soft top sheet. Just chop a ball up from one side wait for it drop on the other side. The reaction is much less on D05. 

Does it mean it is easy to engage the sponge and the blade? I don't think so. A soft surface actually takes longer time to fully pin the ball on the paddle, i.e., to fully stop the ball. That leaves you less time to control the ball. With a hard grippy surface like H3, the ball is pinned immediately. In this regard, it is indeed difficult to control. Similarly, it also takes longer time to release the ball. If your stroke is not stable before the ball is released, it will go in the wrong direction.

These properties mean very differently for amateurs and professionals. For most people, longer engage time requires getting in position fast, i.e., good footwork, hitting into the ball, i.e., good preparation. Longer release time requires good follow through, i.e., solid grip on the ground, one again, good footwork, and proper full stroke. Low throw angle means you need to hit forward more, which is also part of good stroke. So, it just requires good fundamentals. However, if you do have that, this rubber does give you the extra time to do your work, and that is margin of error for the pros.


### How to adjust

D05 is very good at passive serve returns and drop shorts. Just relax and move with your body or arm. Do not use wrist unless you want to go active. Remember, it is a high tension rubber.

For everything else, a good forward motion to engage the rubber is a must. For amateurs, one should constantly remind her/him self that. Also try to avoid thin brushes. Thin contact is just too risky for low throw. Brushing too much, you may over compensating, not enough, the ball goes down. 

D05's comfort zone lies within its low throws. Just hit into the ball. Its low throw angle means if your stroke is a little bit imprecise, it does not really matter. If the incoming ball has some low or medium spin on it, whether top or under, you can just smash it back, or loop drive back if you want to add some insurance. D05 is surprisingly good at smashing under spin balls. The trajectory is flat, floaty, fast, and the ball is heavy. For the same reason, D05 is very good at blocking and countering. Just aim at the other side of the table, punch or smash. 

As I mentioned before, a low throw angle is likely to cause the ball pop up in pushing. So, you need to angle your paddle a little more vertical doing active push.  


### How does it feel

Due to the soft top sheet, D05 does not give clear feedbacks. When pushing, it is kind of muted. When smashing, it feels like dead rubber. Do not get me wrong. It is mighty fast and I equate that dead feeling as stability. D05 only feels good when doing loop drives. It feels like the ball is dragging your rubber down. While using H3N and G1, it feels like you are dragging the ball up. 


### Final thoughts

D05 is a brilliant brilliant innovation from Butterfly. It is clearly designed for offensive 3rd ball, 5th ball attack games. After half a year, I still find it difficult to use. But, while using it, I became self aware of many mistakes I have been doing subconsciously. Analyzing my own mistakes resulted in this essay.
